  "summary": "Python is a free and open-source programming language. The core of extensible programming is defining functions. Python allows mandatory and optional arguments, keyword arguments, and even arbitrary argument lists. Lists can be indexed, sliced and manipulated with other built-in functions. Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more effectively. Experienced programmers in any other language can pick up Python very quickly, and beginners find the clean syntax and indentation structure easy to learn. Django makes it easier to build better web apps more quickly and with less code. Call for Proposals for DjangoCon Africa 2025 is now open! Propose your talk for this headline event, coming to Arusha, Tanzania in August 2025. Django Code of Conduct is a guide to make it easier to enrich technical communities in which we participate. This code applies equally to founders, mentors and those seeking help and guidance. It applies to all spaces managed by the Django project or Django Software Foundation. Members of the Django community should be respectful when dealing with other members. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable. Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and Django is no exception. Django. is a community that lives on its volunteers. As it keeps growing, we always need more people to help others. You can contribute in many ways, either on the framework itself or in the wider ecosystem. There are several ways you can help the Django community. Django\u2019s ticket tracker is the central hub for managing issues, improvements, and contributions to Django. Explore the ways you can make a difference below, and join us in making Django better for everyone. If you want to use Django, you\u2019ll need to install it. The official Django documentation covers everything you need to know about Django. You can help make us better by joining the Django community. Django provides a powerful form library that handles rendering forms as HTML. It also provides a way to generate forms from your existing models and use those forms to create and update data. Django offers full support for translating text into different languages, plus locale-specific formatting. Django provides multiple protections against: Clickjacking Cross-site scripting Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) SQL injection Remote code execution Read more Back to Top Django Links Learn More About Django Getting Started with Django Team Organization Django Software Foundation Code of Conduct Diversity Statement. How-to guides are recipes. guide you through the steps involved in addressing key problems and use-cases. They are more advanced than tutorials and assume some knowledge of how Django works. Django provides an abstraction layer (the \u201cmodels\u201d) for structuring and manipulating the data of your web application. Django offers a robust internationalization and localization framework to assist you in the development of applications for multiple languages and world regions. There are a variety of techniques and tools that can help get your code running more efficiently and using fewer system resources. Django is a registered trademark of the Django Software Foundation. It is important that Django trademark uses are in the spirit of Open Source. Anyone making a profit by using the Django trademark is required to report what proportion of that money will be contributed back to the community. You may use the Django name in any software library that can be used to augment or extend the capabilities of official Django project software. The name of the group or event is formed by combining the name \"Django\" with other words that qualify the geographical location, intended audience, or the activities. You may not use the Django name in the registered name of any company, regardless of whether it offers Django-related services. The website or product does not imply that it is official or otherwise endorsed by the DSF. If a fee is to be charged for the product, or for access to any or all of the material on the website, a clear statement must exist declaring what proportion of those fees will be retained by the authors. Each model is a Python class that subclasses django.db.Model . Each attribute of the model represents a database field. With all of this, Django gives you an automatically-generated database-access API. The most important part of a model is the list of database fields it defines. Fields are specified by class attributes. Be careful not to choose field names that conflict with the models API like clean , save , or delete. The default form widget will be a select box instead of the standard text field and will limit choices to the choices given. The display value for a field with choices can be accessed using the get_FOO_display() method. The default value for the field can be a value or a callable object. If you don\u2019t specify primary_key=True, Django will automatically add an IntegerField to hold the primary key. Each model requires exactly one field to have primary_key=True (either explicitly declared or automatically added) Each field type, except for ForeignKey , ManyToManyField and OneToOneField , takes an optional first positional argument \u2013 a verbose name. ForeignKey requires a positional argument: the class to which the model is related. To define a many-to-many relationship, use ManyToManyField . You use it just like any other Field type: by including it as a class attribute of your model. It requires a positional argument: the class to which the model is related. For example, if a Pizza has multiple Topping objects \u2013 that is, a Topping can be on multiple pizzas and each pizza has multiple toppings \u2013 here\u2019s how you\u2019d represent that: from django.db import models class Topping ( models . Model ): # ... toppings = ManyTo manyField ( Topping ) Django allows you to specify the model that will be used to govern the many-to-many relationship. You can then put extra fields on the intermediate model. The intermediate model is associated with the ManyToManyField using the through argument. You can create many-to-many relationships by creating instances of the intermediate model. You must also specify through_fields as above, or a validation error will be raised. You can also use add() , create() , or set() to create relationships, as long as you specify through-defaults. Once you have established the many-to-many relationships, you can issue queries. For example, to find all the Beatles that joined after 1 Jan 1961 you can query using the attributes of the model. You can also use OneToOneField to define a one- to-one relationship. Django places some restrictions on model field names. A field name cannot be a Python reserved word, because that would result in a Python syntax error. Field name cannot contain more than one underscore in a row, due to Django\u2019s query lookup syntax. The model instance reference has a complete list of methods automatically given to each model. You can override most of these \u2013 see overriding predefined model methods , below. There\u2019s another set of model methods that encapsulate a bunch of database behavior that you\u2019ll want to customize. Model inheritance in Django works almost identically to the way normal class inheritance works in Python. There are three styles of inheritance that are possible in Django. Overridden model methods are not called on bulk operations. You can use pre_delete and/or post_delete signals.  abstract base classes are useful when you want to put some common information into a number of other models. You write your base class and put abstract=True in the Meta class. This model will then not be used to create any database table. Instead, when it is used as a base class for other models, its fields will be added. If you are using related_name or related_query_name on a ForeignKey or ManyToManyField, you must always specify a unique reverse name and query name for the field. This would normally cause a problem in abstract base classes, since the fields on this class are included into each of the child classes. Each installed application name must be unique and the model class names within each app must also be unique. Django. model inheritance is when each model in the hierarchy is a model all by itself. Each model corresponds to its own database table and can be queried and created individually. The inheritance relationship introduces links between the child model and each of its parents (via an automatically-created OneToOneField ). When using multi-table inheritance, a new database table is created for each subclass of a model. Django will automatically create a OneToOneField linking your child class back to any non-abstract parent models. You tell Django that it\u2019s a proxy model by setting the proxy attribute of the Meta class to True.  proxy models inherit Meta attributes in the same way as regular models. There is no way to have Django return a MyPerson object whenever you query for Person objects. A proxy model can inherit from any number of abstract model classes providing they do not define any model fields. Multiple inheritance is possible in Django. It\u2019s possible for a Django model to inherit from multiple parent models. The main use-case where this is useful is for \u201cmix-in\u201d classes. Model managers are inherited from abstract base classes. Overriding an inherited field which is referenced by an inherited Manager may cause subtle bugs. See custom managers and model inheritance for more information. Organizing models in a package may be useful if you have many models. Django is a web framework for perfectionists with deadlines. Donate to support Django development. Report bugs with Django or Django documentation in our ticket tracker. Report security issues only to security @ djangoproject . com. Don\u2019t use the ticket system to ask support questions. Use the Django Forum or the Django Discord server for that. A nice small test case is the best way to report a bug, as it gives us a helpful way to confirm the bug quickly. First request the feature on the Django Forum , not in the ticket tracker. Describe clearly and concisely what the missing feature is. Include example code (non-functional is OK) if possible. Explaining a minimal use case will help others understand where it fits in. Django 5.2 beta 1 is now available. The beta package is not for production use. The release schedule calls for a release candidate in a month from now, and a final release to follow about two weeks after that. Only bugs in new features and regressions from earlier versions of Django will be fixed. The PGP key ID used for this release is Sarah Boyce: 3955B19851EA96EF Back to Top Additional Information Support Django! Martin De Wulf donated to the Django Software Foundation to support Django development. Donate today! The Django Project is managed by a team of volunteers pursuing three goals: Driving the development of the Django web framework, Fostering the ecosystem of Django-related software, Leading the Django community in accordance with the values described in the Django Code of Conduct. The Django Software Foundation handles financial and legal matters related to the Django Project. The steering council selects Mergers as necessary to maintain their number at a minimum of three. There is no upper limit to the number of Mergers. A person may serve in the roles of Releaser and Merger simultaneously. Releasers build Django releases and upload them to the Python Package Index and to the djangoproject.com website. The steering council is a group of experienced contributors who: provide oversight of Django\u2019s development and release process. They assist in setting the direction of feature development and releases, select Mergers and Releasers, and have a tie-breaking vote when other decision-making processes fail. Their main concern is to maintain the quality and stability of the Django Web Framework. A new council is elected after each release cycle of Django. The election process works as follows: The steering council directs one of its members to notify the Secretary of the Django Software Foundation, in writing, of the triggering of the election. As soon as the election is announced, the DSF Board begin a period of voter registration. The five candidates with the highest vote totals immediately become the new steering council. This tutorial begins where Tutorial 1 left off. We\u2019ll set up the database, create your first model, and get a quick introduction to Django\u2019s automatically-generated admin site. Writing your first Django app, part 2. Note the INSTALLED_APPS setting at the top of the file. That holds the names of all Django applications that are activated in this Django instance. Apps can be used in multiple projects, and you can package and distribute them for use by others in their projects. We\u2019ll create two models: Question and Choice. Django apps are \u201cpluggable\u201d: You can use an app in multiple projects. To include the app in our project, we need to add a reference to its configuration class. The PollsConfig class is in the polls/apps.py file, so its dotted path is 'pollsapps.apps.PollsConfig' Run the makemigrations command to add the polls app to your Django settings. Run the migrate command to run the migrations for you and manage your database. The exact output will vary depending on the database you are using. The migrate command takes all the migrations that haven\u2019t been applied and runs them against your database. Migrations are very powerful and let you change your models over time, without the need to delete your database or tables and make new ones. We\u2019ll cover them in more depth in a later part of the tutorial, but for now, remember the three-step guide to making model changes. Polls/models.py adds a new method to the Question model. It\u2019s important to add __str__() methods to your models, not only for your own convenience when dealing with the interactive prompt, but also because objects\u2019 representations are used throughout Django. Note the addition of import datetime and from django.utils import timezone. Django was written in a newsroom environment, with a very clear separation between \u201ccontent publishers\u201d and the \u201cpublic\u201d site. Django entirely automates creation of admin interfaces for models. Site managers use the system to add, change and delete content. Django admin is a unified interface for site administrators to edit content. The admin isn\u2019t intended to be used by site visitors. It\u2019s for site managers. To create an admin user we need to create a user who can login to the admin site. Change the \u201cDate published\u201d by clicking the \u2018Today\u2019 and \u2018Now\u2019 shortcuts. Then click \u2018Save and continue editing\u2019 to save the changes. Save and add another \u2013 Saves changes and loads a new, blank form for this type of object. Delete \u2013 Displays a delete confirmation page. Django makes it easier to build better web apps more quickly and with less code. Call for Proposals for DjangoCon Africa 2025 is now open!

Write your first view. Django 5.1.1 is available open-source under the BSD license. We recommend using the latest version of Python 3. The last version to support Python 2.7 is Django 1.11 LTS. See the FAQ for the Python versions supported by each version. The latest and greatest Django version is the one that\u2019s in our Git repository. This is only for experienced users who want to try incoming changes and help identify bugs before an official release. Feature releases (A.B, A.B+1, etc.) will happen roughly every eight months. Django 5.0.12 is the latest version of the popular Django programming language. The latest official release includes bug fixes and security updates. If you're just looking for a stable deployment target, you'll want to stick with the latest official version. Django\u2019s development team is strongly committed to responsible reporting and disclosure of security-related issues. All reports aim to be resolved within the industry-standard 90 days. Confirmed vulnerabilities with a high severity level will be addressed promptly. Django is a registered trademark of the Django Software Foundation. Developers must always validate and sanitize input before using it. Django contains many private and undocumented functions that are not part of its public API. If a vulnerability depends on directly calling these internal functions in an unsafe way, it will not be considered a valid security issue. The request body must be under 2.5 MB. The Django Template Language (DTL) is designed for building the content needed to display web pages. Under default configurations, Django makes it difficult for sites to accidentally accept such payloads from untrusted sources. If it is necessary to display large amounts of user-provided content, it\u2019s important that basic security measures are taken. Django discloses security issues through a series of steps. Severity levels are: High Remote code execution SQL injection Moderate Cross site scripting (XSS) Denial-of-service attacks Low Sensitive data exposure Unvalidated redirects/forwards Django team maintains an archive of security issues disclosed in Django. Full list of people and organizations who receive advance notification is not and will not be made public. List is not simply a list of users of Django, and being a user is not sufficient reason to be placed on the notification list. Once submitted, your request will be considered by the Django development team. You will receive a reply notifying you of the result of your request within 30 days. For individuals, the ID of a public key associated with your address can be used to verify email received from you and encrypt email sent to you.

Apache Subversion is an open-source, centralized version control system. It is developed as a project of the Apache Software Foundation. We're always in need of individuals with a wide range of skills. Here's how to get started. The \"Getting Subversion\" section of the website is all about making sure Subversion finds it way into your hands. The \"Community\" section is where you interact and give. The rest of this site is about Subversion \u2014 but Subversion doesn't operate in a vacuum. In the following examples, input and output are distinguished by the presence or absence of prompts. To repeat the example, you must type everything after the prompt. Comments in Python start with the hash character, # , and extend to the end of the physical line. The equal sign ( = ) is used to assign a value to a variable. If a variable is not \u201cdefined\u201d (assigned a value), trying to use it will give you an error. In interactive mode, the last printed expression is assigned to the variable _. String literals can span multiple lines. End-of-line characters are automatically included in the string, but it\u2019s possible to prevent this by adding a \\ at the end of the line. Strings can be concatenated with the + operator. Indexing is used to obtain individual characters, slicing allows you to obtain a substring. Slice indices have useful defaults; an omitted first index defaults to zero. The first row of numbers gives the position of the indices 0\u20266 in the string; the second row gives the corresponding negative indices. Python knows a number of compound data types, used to group together other values. The most versatile is the list, which can be written as a list of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets. Unlike strings, which are immutable , lists are a mutable type, i.e. it is possible to change their content. In Python, like in C, any non-zero integer value is true; zero is false. Assignment to slices is also possible, and this can even change the size of the list or clear it entirely. The built-in function len() also applies to lists.

The interpreter acts as a simple calculator: you can type an expression at it and it will write the value. There is full support for floating point; operators with mixed type operands convert the integer operand to floating point. In interactive mode, the last printed expression is assigned to the variable _ . Python can manipulate text (represented by type :class:`str` , so-called \"strings\") as well as numbers. Text can be enclosed in single quotes ( '...' ) or double quotes ( \"...\" ) with the same result. String literals can span multiple lines. End-of-line characters are automatically included in the string. Strings can be concatenated (glued together) with the + operator, and repeated with * : >>> # 3 times 'un', followed by 'ium' 'unununium' Two or more string literals next to each other are automatically concatenate. This only works with two literals, not with variables or expressions. Python knows a number of compound data types, used to group together other values. The most versatile is the list, which can be written as a list of comma-separated values. Lists might contain items of different types, but usually the items all have the same type. Simple assignment in Python never copies data. When you assign a list to a variable, the variable refers to the existing list. Assignment to slices is also possible, and this can even change the size of the list. It is possible to nest lists (create lists containing other lists) The body of the loop is indented : indentation is Python's way of grouping statements. At the interactive prompt, you have to type a tab or space(s) for each indented line. Strings are printed without quotes, and a space is inserted between items.
